# Rejuvenate_Heritage
Tech4Heritage Hackathon
* Team Name - Ancient_AI
* Team_ID - 128

## Problem Statement
* Create a Generator Model that can regenerate broken paintings with filling of missing parts (discontinuities):

	* Build a function that can objectively identify the discontinuities and the missing elements.
	* Build functions that can choose the right missing elements for the various types of missing elements identified in the above-mentioned functions. The choice of the right missing elements will be driven by the learning of the data sets in this problem statement.
	* Create multiple outputs out of the above-mentioned functions and create functions to choose the most relevant output (optimization of the functions).

* Create a Comparator or Discriminator Model to compare results of the outputs of the generative model with real image and provide probabilities of accuracy:
	* Create a function that can compare generated output with the accepted output and calculate level of accuracy ▪ Based on multiple data sets, calculate and provide probability functions mentioning the expected level of accuracy of restoration for any image that enters the generative model.
	* Train the generative model accordingly along with further training of this comparator model. Try to reach “equilibrium”.
* Objective at the end of Hackathon:
	* Create a system that reads a damaged image (with missing portions), identifies the areas that are damaged, and uses a model to fill the spaces that are missing using scientific assumptions drawn out of the sample datasets, effectively being able to restore any image similar to the sample dataset shared.

## SOLUTION APPROACH

* We required a solution that would first detect the spots/irregularities in the image and then try to fill the spots based on the surrounding region of the spots/irregularities and other images in the dataset on which our GAN model is trained.
	* The first requirement was to build a dataset on our own , since datasets on damaged and corresponding clean paintings is not readily available. Steps for how we created our dataset -
		* We took some damaged pantings as shown in **data/Damaged/** folder . With Opencv we did color segmentation and took out spots from the damaged images . We then renamed the damaged images according to their lower and higher hsv values which we got from color segmentation.(This can be seen in **src/editing.ipynb**)
		* Then we took some clean paintings as shown in **data/Clean/** folder . We then overlayed the spots taken out from the damaged images as in above step on the clean images . (This can be seen in **src/generate_dataset.ipynb**)
		* Then to add some old affect and tint we applied Neural Style Transfer on the overlayed images . We downloaded some textures for style transfer to be applied on the paintings passed through the above step . The textures are in **data/Textures/** folder .(This can be seen in **src/generate_dataset.ipynb**)
		* Our dataset saves clean image , a damged image and a mask image(mask for the spots) . These three images will pass through the models we make further .
		* Link for the dataset we created - [Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KgaaPV0NrPlJj-FVv-DR0P8cql4G0LAQ?usp=sharing)
	* Now the next task was to automatically detect the spots/irregularities on the damaged images . We did this through Mask-Segmentation .
		* The model we used for Mask-Segmentation is Unet-Architecture . We pass the images we created and train our unet-architecture .
		* We chose U-Net because of its simple architecture and efficient and accurate results .(This can be seen in **src/Mask-Segmentation.ipynb**)
	* Then the next and most important step was creating a General-Adversial-Network model. For the network we chose following things -
		* Partial Convolution Layer - We refer to our partial convolution operation and mask update function jointly as the Partial Convolutional Layer. Here the mask updates itself and at last becomes all ones .(This can be seen in **src/PCONV_LAYER.py**)
		* Network Design - We again designed a UNet-like architecture for the model . Existing deep learning based image inpainting methods use a standard convolutional network over the corrupted image, using convolutional filter responses conditioned on both valid pixels as well as the substitute values in the masked holes (typically the mean value). This often leads to artifacts such as color discrepancy and blurriness. That’s why partial convolutions worked out well. (This can be seen in **src/PCONV_UNET.py**)
		* Loss Functions - Final loss is the sum of-
			* Per-pixel losses both for maskes and un-masked regions
			* Perceptual loss based on ImageNet pre-trained VGG-16 (pool1, pool2 and pool3 layers)
			* Style loss on VGG-16 features both for predicted image and for computed image (non-hole pixel set to ground truth)
			* Total variation loss for a 1-pixel dilation of the hole region
			* (This can be seen in **src/PCONV_UNET.py**)
		* Metrics - We have implemented Peak signal-to-noise ratio(PSNR) as our metric . While most 1D signal use RMSE(root mean square error) / SNR(signal to noise ratio)  images are different, in images it is clear that optimizing image towards RMSE (or the squared error) gives the "blurred" signal advantage which means edges are blurred. Since our visual system is very sensitive to edges, a different metric had to be created. Thus, the PSNR is recommended and it became the standard because it matched the visual system better then the RMSE/SNR. (This can be seen in **src/PCONV_UNET.py**)
	* Next step was to train the model on our dataset . We trained for 800 epochs and still training for more ...
		* We first trained for 100 epochs with Learning rate of 0.0001 and batch normalization enabled in all layers . 
		* Then for another 100 epochs with Learning rate of 0.00005 and batch normalization in all encoding layers is disabled.
		* Repeat this process in loop till no of epochs you want .
		* Augmentation is enabled randomly .
		* (This can be seen in **src/training.ipynb**)
		* We can predict the model we created with all the weights and files (**src/PCONV_UNET.py** , **src/PCONV_LAYER.py** , **src/predict_gan.py** , **src/predict_mask.py**) kept in one folder with the help of **src/predict.ipynb** .


## Future Improvement 

- Better Neural Style Transfer Model
- Better System requirements for training .
- More Damaged and Clean images for making mode really damaged images .
